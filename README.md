# BattleField

The program is used to generate a simulation for a battlefield using Java.
The players on the battlefield are the soldiers, hostages, predator and geurilla.
The soldiers are present at the Bunkers whereas the Guerillas are in the enemyBase.
The target is to rescue the hostages from the enemy base and tranport them safely to the chopper.
During the rescue mission, the players could get attacked by a predator. On fighting the predator, based on the fight result the hostage is either rescued or sent back to the enemy base.
